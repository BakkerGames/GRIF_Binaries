## GRIF Binaries

GRIF, or Game Runner for Interactive Fiction, is an application for playing Interactive Fiction games from the console. It is designed so that the game data and logic are stored in external `*.grif` data files, which GRIF loads and executes.

This GitHub site contains executable binaries for various systems.

Each includes LICENSE.md, README.md, DETAILS.md, SYNTAX.md, and a demo "Cloak Of Darkness" game.

GRIF is written in C# .NET 8. See the [GRIF](https://github.com/BakkerGames/GRIF) GitHub site for full source.

The "grif" or "grif.exe" executables are self-contained and do not require .NET 8 to be installed.
